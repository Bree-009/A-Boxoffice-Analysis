# A Box Office Analysis
## Introduction
In the fast pace of modern life, watching movies has become increasingly popular. People watch movies as a means to relax, learn life skills, learn a new language, get motivation or even as background noise as they do something else. 
As of early 2022, Netflix, a popular streaming site, recorded  users watching over 400 million hours of content per week globally.

The box office refers to the degree of success of a film or play in terms of the number of people who go to watch it or the amount of money it makes. 
According to Medium; the recipe for creating a box office success is complex and multifaceted. It requires a combination of compelling storytelling, talented actors, stunning visuals, strategic marketing, cultural relevance, and above all else, an emotional connection with the audience.
